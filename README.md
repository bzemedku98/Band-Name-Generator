# Band-Name-Generator

For this project, I'm creating a simple website that generates silly band names once the user clicks on the button "Generate Band Name".

In order to run this site, you must clone it on your machine using this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/bzemedku98/Secrets.git
```
//Make sure to have node.js installed before proceeding further.
Then run ``` npm install ``` to install all the node and json packages.
Once you've done that, you can run it by doing ```node index.js ``` on your terminal.
